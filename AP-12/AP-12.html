            <div class="note-element">
                Gravity is a concept of force, it describes the interaction between two objects with mass. For an object on Earth, we can consider gravity as the gravitational force that the Earth exerts on the object. Through experiments, we know that near the surface of the Earth, an object under the influence of gravity will accelerate, and its acceleration value is approximately <span class="math">g = 9.8 \ \rm{m/s^2}</span>. According to Newton's second law of motion, we can deduce that the gravity an object experiences near the surface of the Earth is <span class="math">F = m  g</span>, where <span class="math">m</span> is the mass of the object.

                <div class="note-element">
                    The concept of weight is basically similar to gravity, but <span class="highlight">accurately speaking, weight refers to the reading on the scale, that is, the force received by the scale</span>. When an object is not affected by other external forces, its weight is equal to the gravity it experiences. We can record their
                    relationship as follows:
                    <div class="note-element formula counter">
                        <span class="math">W = mg</span>
                    </div>
                    However, when an object is affected by other external forces, its weight will change accordingly. For example,suppose an object has a mass of <span class="math">m</span> and is affected by gravity and an upward external force<span class="math">F_{\text{up}}</span>, the force received by the scale will become <span class="math"> m g -F_{\text{up}}</span>, so the weight will also become <span class="math">W = m g - F_{\text{up}}</span>.

                It is known that the weight of an object measured on the Alpha planet is 6 times that of the earth.

                Tension is a concept of force, it describes the pulling force transmitted by a string, cable, chain, or similar one-dimensional continuous object, or by each end of a rod, truss member, or similar three-dimensional object. Tension might also be described as the action-reaction pair of forces acting at each end of the said elements. Tension could depend on the length and elasticity of the object, and the force applied. The unit of tension is the same as the unit of force, that is, Newton (N).

                    In the context of a light string, the term <em class="em1">light</em> refers to the string being <em class="em1">massless or of negligible mass</em>. When a force is applied to such a string, it can be assumed that the tension throughout the string is uniform. This is because a light string does not have its own weight to affect the tension. Therefore, the tension at one end of the string is equal to the tension at the other end.
