            <div class="note-title">What is a force?</div>
            <div class="note-element">
                A force describes the interaction between objects, which can be distinguished as pushing and pulling forces. For example, a small ball with mass will be attracted by the earth, and this attraction is a kind of force called gravity. Intuitively, when the state of motion of an object is changed, whether from rest to motion, or from motion to rest, or from an accelerating state to a non-accelerating state, the action of force is indispensable.

            <div class="note-element note-subtitle">How to represent the force of an object?</div>
            <div class="note-element">
                In physics, we often use force diagrams to represent the force of an object. For example, suppose there is a block that is subjected to a pulling force to the left. We can represent the force on this object in the form of an arrow, where the direction of the arrow is to the left, the length of the arrow is the magnitude of the force, and the base of the arrow is the point of application of the force.

            <div class="note-element note-subtitle">Net Force</div>
            <div class="note-element">
                When an object is affected by multiple forces, we usually use the sum of the forces to represent the force on the object, and these summed forces are called net force. In a one-dimensional system, we can simply calculate the net force by adding and subtracting real numbers. For example, if an object is subjected to two forces, one downward force of 5 units and one upward force of 3 units, then the net force on this object is a downward force of 2 units.

                When the <em class="em1">net force on an object in the system is zero</em>, we call it force balance (translation equilibrium), which usually presents a state of <em class="em1">rest</em> or <em class="em1">constant velocity</em> in physics.
