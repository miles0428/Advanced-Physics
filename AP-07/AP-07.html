            <div class="note-element">
                Uniform circular motion is a special type of two-dimensional motion in which an object moves in a fixed circular path at a constant speed. In this motion, although the magnitude of the speed is constant, its direction is constantly changing, so the object has a centripetal acceleration, always pointing towards the center of the circle.

        </div>

            <div class="note-element">
                In uniform circular motion, we can express the position of the object as:
            </div>
            <div class="formula note-element counter">
                <span class="math">r(t) = r  \cos(\omega t) \hat{i} + r  \sin(\omega t) \hat{j}</span>
            </div>
            <div class="note-element">
                Where <span class="math">r</span> is the radius of the circular motion, <span class="math">\omega</span> is the angular velocity, representing the speed of the object's rotation. When the variation of <span class="math"> \omega t </span> is <span class="math">2\pi</span>, the object moves one circle along the circular motion, so we can also express the period as <span class="math">T = \frac{2\pi}{\omega}</span>.
            </div>
            <div class="note-element">
                The velocity is the derivative of the position with respect to time, so we can get:
            </div>
            <div class="formula note-element counter">
                <span class="math">v(t) = \frac{dr(t)}{dt} = -r \omega \sin(\omega t) \hat{i} + r \omega \cos(\omega t) \hat{j}</span>
            </div>
            <div class="note-element">
                The acceleration is the derivative of the velocity with respect to time, so we can get:
            </div>
            <div class="formula note-element counter">
                <span class="math">a(t) = \frac{dv(t)}{dt} = -r \omega^2 \cos(\omega t) \hat{i} - r \omega^2 \sin(\omega t) \hat{j}</span>
            </div>
            <div class="note-element">
                From equation (3) we can see that the direction of acceleration is completely opposite to the direction of position, it is a vector pointing to the center, we can also call it centripetal acceleration.

                In uniform circular motion, the magnitude of the velocity can be easily obtained from equation (2) as shown in the following formula:
            </div>
            <div class="formula note-element counter">
                <span class="math">v = r \omega</span>
            </div>
            <div class="note-element">
                We can also use a similar concept to get the magnitude of acceleration, as shown in the following formula:
            </div>
            <div class="formula note-element counter">
                <span class="math">a = r \omega^2</span>
            </div>
            <div class="note-element">
                We can also get the relationship between the magnitude of velocity and acceleration from equations (5) and (6):
            </div>
            <div class="formula note-element counter">
                <span class="math">a = \frac{v^2}{r}</span>
            </div>
            <div class="note-element">
                From equation (4) we can also express the period as
            </div>
            <div class="formula note-element counter">
                <span class="math">T = \frac{2\pi}{\omega} = \frac{2\pi r}{v}</span>
            </div>
            <div class="note-element">
                From the above formula, we can also see that the physical meaning of the period can also be expressed as the distance of one circle divided by the magnitude of the velocity.
