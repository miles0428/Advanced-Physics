                In this unit, we will understand some forces related to other forces acting on an object or the state of motion of an object. Usually, the magnitude or direction of these forces will be affected by the current state of the object. For example, the magnitude of friction is related to the horizontal and vertical forces acting on the object at that moment.

            <div class="note-element">
                Friction is a common resistive force in daily life. When an object experiences <span class="highlight">friction</span>, the force exerted on the object mainly manifests as <span class="highlight">preventing the object from sliding</span>. For example, when a block slides on a non-smooth surface, friction forms a force opposite to the direction of sliding, preventing the object from sliding. In physics, friction is divided into static friction and kinetic friction. Static friction refers to the friction experienced when the object is at rest, while kinetic friction refers to the friction experienced when the object is in motion.

                Static Friction
            </div>
            <div class="note-element">
                Static friction refers to the friction experienced when an object is at rest. For example, when we push a stone on the ground, we apply an external force, but the stone does not move. This is because the static friction experienced by the object counteracts the force applied to push the stone, keeping it at rest. From the above example, we can understand that when we apply a force parallel to the ground on an object, a static friction force opposite to that force will be generated. Therefore, we can write the formula for static friction and external force as follows, where <span class="math">\vec{F}_{\text{ext}}</span> represents the external force acting on the object, and <span class="math">\vec{f}_s</span> represents the static friction force acting on the object.
            </div>

            <div class = "formula note-element counter">
                <span class="math">
                    \vec{F}_{\text{ext}} = -\vec{f}_s

        <div class = "note-box" title="Static Friction">
            <div class="note-element note-subtitle">
                Maximum Static Friction
            </div>
            <div class="note-element">
                Static friction describes the resistance of an object on a non-smooth interface, but static friction cannot always prevent the object from moving. Imagine a large stone that cannot be pushed by a person, but if we use a truck, we can easily pull the stone. So we know that static friction has an upper limit, which we denote as <span class="math">\vec{f}_{\text{max}}</span>, the maximum static friction.
            </div>

            <div class="note-element">
                The maximum static friction is also related to the interaction between the object and the interface (i.e., the normal force applied to the object). The greater the interaction between the interface and the object, the harder it is to move the object, and the greater the maximum static friction of the object. We can easily imagine two stones, one large and one small. The larger stone requires more force to move, which means the maximum static friction of the larger stone is greater.
            </div>
            <div class="note-element">
                Additionally, the maximum static friction is also related to the roughness of the interface. The greater the roughness, the greater the maximum static friction of the object. Physicists write the interaction between the interfaces as the maximum static friction coefficient <span class="math">\mu_s</span>. The larger the value, the rougher the interface.
            </div>
            <div class="note-element">
                Therefore, we can write the maximum static friction as the following formula, where <span class="math">\vec{f}_{\text{max}}</span> represents the maximum static friction, <span class="math">\mu_s</span> represents the friction coefficient of the interface, and <span class="math">\vec{N}</span> represents the normal force .

            <div class="note-element formula counter">
                <span class="math">
                    |\vec{f}_{\text{max}}| = \mu_s |\vec{N}|

        <div class = "note-box" title="Kinetic Friction">
            <div class="note-element note-title">
                Kinetic Friction
            </div>
            <div class="note-element">
                Kinetic friction refers to the frictional force experienced by an object in motion. When an object slides over a surface, kinetic friction generates a force opposite to the direction of motion, which slows down the object's speed. For example, when we slide on ice, although the ice surface is relatively smooth, there is still kinetic friction, which is why we eventually stop.
            </div>
            <div class="note-element">
                Similar to the maximum static friction, kinetic friction is also related to the roughness of the contact surface and the normal force. We can express the magnitude of kinetic friction using the following formula, where <span class="math">\vec{f}_k</span> represents kinetic friction, <span class="math">\mu_k</span> represents the coefficient of kinetic friction, and <span class="math">\vec{N}</span> represents the normal force.
            </div>
            <div class="note-element formula counter">
                <span class="math em1">
                    |\vec{f}_k| = \mu_k |\vec{N}|
                </span>
            </div>
            <div class="note-element">
                According to experiments, we can know that the magnitude of kinetic friction is usually smaller than the maximum static friction. This is because when an object starts to move, the contact points between surfaces decrease, thereby reducing friction. This is also why when we push a heavy object, it feels difficult at first, but once the object starts moving, it becomes easier to push.

        <div class="note-box" title="Air Resistance">
            <div class="note-title note-element">
                Air Resistance
            </div>
            <div class="note-element">
                Air resistance describes the resistance that an object encounters when moving through the air. When an object moves through the air, air resistance generates a force opposite to the direction of the object's motion, slowing down its speed. For example, when we ride a bicycle, air resistance slows us down.
            </div>
            <div class="note-element">
                Typically, air resistance is related to the following factors: it is proportional to the square of the object's speed, proportional to the object's surface area, and proportional to the air density. Therefore, we can describe air resistance using the following formula, where <span class="math">\vec{f}_a</span> represents air resistance, <span class="math">v</span> represents the object's speed, <span class="math">A</span> represents the object's surface area, <span class="math">\rho</span> represents air density, and <span class="math">C_d</span> represents the drag coefficient.
            </div>
            <div class="note-element formula counter">
                <span class="math">
                    |\vec{f}_a| = \frac{1}{2} C_d \rho A v^2
                </span>
            </div>
            <div class="note-element">
                For example, when we ride a bicycle, we can clearly feel the effect of air resistance. The faster we ride, the stronger the headwind we feel, which is due to the increased air resistance with speed. Additionally, if we wear loose clothing, the increased frontal area will result in more resistance; whereas if we wear tight-fitting sportswear, the resistance will be reduced. Similarly, in high-altitude areas, due to lower air density, the resistance encountered while riding will also be relatively smaller.

        <div class = "note-box" title="Terminal Velocity">
            <div class="note-element note-title">
                Terminal Velocity
            </div>
            <div class="note-element">
                It is foreseeable that if we have an external force acting on a moving object, the speed will increase with the acceleration of the external force, and thus the air resistance will also increase. When the air resistance becomes equal to the external force, the forces reach equilibrium, resulting in constant speed motion, and this speed is called terminal velocity. Therefore, we can derive the terminal velocity of an object as follows:
            </div>
            <div class="note-element">
                First, we know that at terminal velocity, the external force on the object is equal to the air resistance, so we can write the following equation:
            </div>
            <div class="note-element formula counter">
                <span class="math">
                    \vec{F}_{\text{ext}} = - \vec{f}_a = \frac{1}{2} C_d \rho  v_{\text{term}}^2
                </span>
            </div>
            <div class="note-element">
                Then we can calculate the terminal velocity as follows:
            </div>
            <div class="note-element formula counter">
                <span class="math">
                    v_{\text{term}} = \sqrt{\frac{2 \vec{F}_{\text{ext}}}{C_d \rho A}}
                </span>
            </div>
            <div class="note-element">
                From this, we can also know that the terminal velocity of an object in free fall can be expressed as:
            </div>
            <div class="note-element formula counter">
                <span class="math">
