                If there are two observers observing the motion of an object, one observer is stationary, and the other observer is moving in one direction, then these two observers will see different situations of the object's motion. In this case, we call it relative motion. We can call the perspectives of the two observers as <em class="em1">frames</em>, and <em class="em2">relative motion
                </em> is our mutual conversion of an object in the frames of these two observers.

            <div class="note-element">
                One-dimensional relative motion, as the name suggests, is a conversion of an object in two one-dimensional frames, and both observers can only see what happens on the line. In this case, we can use the following formula to describe the frame conversion observed by two observers under one-dimensional frames.

            <div class="note-element">
                According to the properties of differentiation, we can differentiate the right side of the above equation with respect to time to get the following equation.

                From the above equation, we can get that the velocity <span class="math">v_{oa}</span> of the object in the frame of observer A is the sum of the velocity <span class="math">v_{ob}</span> of the object observed by observer B and the velocity <span class="math">v_{ba}</span> of observer B in the frame of observer A, which is similar to the description of position.

                As mentioned in our previous unit, multi-dimensional motion can be represented in the form of vectors, so multi-dimensional relative motion can also be represented in the form of vectors. We can use vector addition to describe the position of multi-dimensional relative motion as shown in the following formula.

            Similar to the description of one-dimensional motion, we can simply replace the addition of positions with vector addition to get the position of multi-dimensional relative motion.

                As in the previous method, we can differentiate <span class="math">\vec{r}_{oa}</span> to get the velocity <span class="math">\vec{v}_{oa}</span> of multi-dimensional relative motion as shown in the following formula.

            <div class="note-element">
                Similarly, in vectors, we can also differentiate two added vectors separately, as shown in the following formula.

                In this way, we can get the velocity of multi-dimensional relative motion. The physical meaning is the same as that of one-dimensional relative motion. We can express the velocity of the object observed by observer A as the velocity of the object observed by observer B plus the velocity of observer B observed by observer A.

                From the perspective of a pilot, when a bomber drops a bomb, the bomb appears to be a free fall straight down. Now the bomber is flying east at a speed of 300m/s and drops a bomb at a height of 1000 meters. A photographer on the ground is shooting the trajectory of the bomb drop. Please find out the relationship the position and the velocity of the bomb observed by the photographer over the time. What is the trajectory of the bomb shot by the photographer?
