            <div class="note-element">
                In one-dimensional motion, we use <span class="math em1">x</span> to denote the position of an object, and <span class="math em2">\Delta x</span> to denote the displacement. Both are scalars, as we can simply use positive or negative numbers to represent them.
            </div>
            <div class="note-element">
                However, in two or three-dimensional motion, we need to describe the position in a more complex space. Therefore, we use <span class="math">x</span> and <span class="math">y</span> to denote the position of an object in two or three-dimensional space, and <span class="math">\Delta x</span> and <span class="math">\Delta y</span> to denote the displacement. If we combine these terms, we can form a vector <span class="math em1">\overrightharpoon{r} = \left( x,y,... \right)</span> (sometimes written as <span class="math">\overrightharpoon{x}, \bold{r}, \bold{x}</span>) to represent the position, and <span class="math em2">\Delta \overrightharpoon{r} = \left( \Delta x, \Delta y,... \right)</span> to represent the displacement in two or three-dimensional space.

            <div class="note-element">
                In physics, we use unit vector notation to represent the position and displacement of an object in two or three-dimensional space. For example, we use <span class="math em3">\hat{i}, \hat{j}, and \hat{k}</span> to represent the unit vectors in the <span class="math em3">x, y, and z</span> directions, respectively. Therefore, we can represent the position of an object in multi-dimensional space as <span class="math em1">\overrightharpoon{r} = x\hat{i} + y\hat{j} + ...</span>, and the displacement as <span class="math em2">\Delta \overrightharpoon{r} = \Delta x\hat{i} + \Delta y\hat{j} + ...</span>.
