                Projectile motion refers to the motion of an object projected into the air and subject only to acceleration as a result of gravity. The object is called a projectile, and its path is called its trajectory.

                In Projectile Motion, generally, we will assume that the object projected with an initial velocity of <span class="math">v_{0}</span> and an angle of <span class="math">\theta</span>. Therefore, the initial horizontal and vertical components of the motion are given by:

                The horizontal part of the projectile motion is not affected by gravity (, sometime might contain air resistance or drag, depending on the situation, which is not considered here), so the acceleration can be neglected. Thus, we can write the equations of motion as:

If throwing a ball harder, we can find the horizontal range of the ball is longer. And if we throw a ball with different angle, it will also affect the horizontal range of the ball.

                The maximum height is also an important factor in projectile motion. We can find the maximum height by following methods.

                Method 1: Use the equation of motion to find the point maximum height.

            <div>
                As we know, the maximum height means the height when the vertical velocity becomes zero.
                (Or in Math , the maximum height means the first derivative of the height function is zero, we also need to check the second derivative of the height function is negative , which means the acceleration is negative in physics.)

                As we know, the path of the projectile is a parabola, so the maximum height is the vertex of the parabola. We can simply derivate the equation of path to find where the maximum height is.

                The maximum height can also be found using the equation of the path of the projectile.
