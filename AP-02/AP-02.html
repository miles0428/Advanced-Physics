            <div class="note-element">
                Motion is used to describe the change of position or rotation of an object over time. For example, if an object falls down, it's a kind of motion.
            </div>
            <div class="note-element">
                First, we will talk about the motion of an object along a straight line (or 1-dimensional motion). We will discuss how to describe the motion in terms of position, velocity, and acceleration.

                The position of an object is the distance from the origin of the coordinate system (you can choose any origin you want).

                        If an object moves from point A to point B, the distance between A and B is called the displacement.

            </div>
            <div class="note-element">
                The velocity describes how fast an object is moving. If the velocity is 0, it means that the object is not moving. In physics, we usually use the symbol <span class="math em1">v</span> to describe the velocity.

                Average Velocity
            </div>
            <div class="note-element">
                The average velocity describes how fast an object moves from its initial position to its final position over a time period. The average velocity is independent of the path of the object (or we can say the average velocity is not relative to the path of the object). If an object has a displacement of <span class="math em2"> \Delta x</span> during a time period of <span class="math em2">\Delta t</span>, the average velocity <span class="math em1">v_{avg}</span> is <span class="math em2"> \Delta x / \Delta t</span>.

                <span class="math">

                The definition of average speed is quite similar to the definition of average velocity. It has only one difference: the average speed is relative to the path of the object.
                We can write the average speed <span class="math em1">s_{avg}</span> as <span class="math em2"> \frac{total \ distance} {\Delta t }</span>.
