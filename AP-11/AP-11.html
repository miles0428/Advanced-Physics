                Newton's Laws of Motion are a set of laws that describe the motion of objects in physics. They were first proposed in 1687 by Newton, who summarized them based on the experiments and principles developed by his predecessors to explain the relationship between force and the motion of objects. Newton's three laws of motion are the First Law of Motion, the Second Law of Motion, and the Third Law of Motion, which can also be referred to as the Law of Inertia, the Law of Acceleration, and the Law of Action and Reaction, respectively.

                Newton's First Law describes that, <span class="highlight">when an object is not subjected to any force, it tends to maintain its original state of motion</span>, that is, when an object is at rest, if it is not subjected to any force, it will remain at rest. If an object is in motion, if it is not subjected to any force, it will maintain uniform linear motion, which can also be referred to as the Law of Inertia.

                Newton's Second Law, also known as the Law of Acceleration, describes that when an object is subjected to a force and the sum of the forces is greater than zero, the force will give the object an acceleration, the magnitude of which will be related to the size of the sum of the forces and the mass in the following relationship:
